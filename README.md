# My Installation Script

This is a shell script to automate the installation of most packages and softwares used by me to develop in a Linux environment. Feel free to clone or fork this repository and adapt to your needs!


## üöß Disclaimer

Tested **only** on a fresh installation of **[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)**. More specifically on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 21.10.


## üíø Installation

You can just run this single command on a shell (needs `curl`):
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mateussantana/install-script/master/install.sh)"
```

*or...*

Cloning this repository (needs `git`) and running ``install.sh``:

## üèóÔ∏è Editing and testing

If you want to adapt this installation script to your needs, consider to use docker to test.

```bash
# Build docker image and run test non interactively as root
docker build -t install-script .
docker run --rm install-script bash install.sh
```

*or...*

```bash
# Run test interactively as a regular system user
# user: ubuntu
# password: ubuntu
docker run --rm -it -u ubuntu:ubuntu install-script bash install.sh
```

*or...*

```bash
# Map current work directory to container and run test as you go
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/ubuntu/install-script -u ubuntu:ubuntu install-script
```
